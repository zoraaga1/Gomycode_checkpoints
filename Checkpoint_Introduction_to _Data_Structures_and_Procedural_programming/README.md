# ðŸ“Œ Algorithm Solutions for Set Sum and Dot Product Problems

## ðŸ§® Overview

This repository contains solutions to two algorithmic problems:

1. **Finding the sum of all distinct elements from two sets** (Problem 1).
2. **Calculating the dot product of two vectors and checking for orthogonality** (Problem 2).

### Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements from Two Sets

Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from both sets. In other words, find the sum of all elements that are present in either of the two sets.

- **Example Input**:
  - Set 1: `[3, 1, 7, 9]`
  - Set 2: `[2, 4, 1, 9, 3]`
  
- **Expected Output**: `13`  
  **Explanation**: The distinct elements are `4, 7, 2`. The sum is `4 + 7 + 2 = 13`.

  #### **Description**:

You are tasked with writing a procedure called `dot_product` which calculates the **dot product** (scalar product) of two vectors, `v1` and `v2`. The result will be stored in a variable `ps`.

Additionally, you are required to determine, for `n` pairs of vectors, whether the vectors are **orthogonal**. Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero.
